# Autonomous Weapon System Implementation in VHDL

## Scenario
An autonomous target tracking and engagement system for a drone.

### Axioms
- **A1**: Engage only if the target matches the predefined criteria (e.g., a specific heat signature).
- **A2**: Cease engagement if the target moves into a restricted area (e.g., civilian zones).
- **A3**: Periodically recalibrate sensors to adapt to environmental changes.

## FPGA Implementation Overview

### Input Processing
The FPGA receives inputs from various sensors (e.g., infrared sensors for heat signature detection).

### Axiom Implementation
- **A1 Processing**: Logic implemented to compare sensor data with the target criteria. If the criteria are met, a signal to engage is sent.
- **A2 Processing**: Geofencing logic implemented. If the target enters a restricted area, a signal to cease engagement is sent.
- **A3 Processing**: A timer-based routine for sensor recalibration is implemented.

### Output Control
Based on the processing, the FPGA controls the drone's weapon systems (e.g., enabling or disabling weapon firing).

## Axioms in the Code

- **Axiom A1 (Target Matching)**: Implemented through the comparison of sensor input with predefined target criteria. The `target_matched` signal is set to '1' (true) if the sensor input matches the target criteria, and '0' (false) otherwise.
- **Axiom A2 (Geofencing)**: Determines whether the target is in a restricted area. The `in_restricted_area` signal is set based on the `geofence_input`, indicating if the target is in a restricted area ('1' for true, '0' for false).

## Decision-Making

The `engage_output` signal represents the final decision of the system based on the evaluation of the axioms. This signal is set to '1' (engage) only when `target_matched` is '1' (the target meets criteria) and `in_restricted_area` is '0' (the target is not in a restricted area). This logic ensures that the system will only engage the target if it matches the criteria and is not in a restricted zone.
